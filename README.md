# sense_practical

This repository contains materials for the SENSE practical on agent-based
modelling as part of the training week on Machine Learning and AI.

## Getting started

* Cloning down the repository
* Setting up the environment
* Accessing data
* Using `jupyter-notebooks`/`jupyter-lab`

### Setting up the environment

This repository contains an `environment.yml` file, which documents the python
packages that are required to run this practical.
The easiest way to install this list of packages is to open your terminal or
anaconda prompt and run the following command:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will create a conda environment named `sense-abm` which will contain all of
the required packages.
The environment can then be activated by running the following command:
```
conda activate sense-abm
```
Be aware that we should ensure that this environment is activated before running
any of the notebooks for the practicals.

## Practical Outline
