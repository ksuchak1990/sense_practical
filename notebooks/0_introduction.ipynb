    "The raw data on which this model is based, along with a video from which it is derived, can be found [here](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/grandcentral.html); the video shows pedestrians traversing the concourse area over a 30 minute period, and the derived data details the paths of these pedestrians."

    "Agent-based models (sometimes referred to as individual-based models), have become widely used in a range of fields including social systems (e.g. the modelling of pedestrian movements (Liu et al. 2014)), systems pharmacology (e.g. the evolution of cellular systems  and the impact of different intervention measures (Cosgrove et al. 2015)), and ecological systems (e.g. the simulation of habitat-selection in fish populations (Railsback & Harvey2002)).\n",
    "Whilst there have existed a number of other modelling techniques prior to the introduction of agent-based models, many of them took the form of differential equation-based models (Parunak et al. 1998). Such equation-based models seek to describe the behaviour of systems at an aggregate level, often assuming some level of homogeneity in the population.\n",
    "Agent-based models, on the other hand, seek to describe the behaviour of the individuals in the system, allowing the emergence of aggregate behaviour from their interactions."

    "In agent-based models, individuals are characterised as discrete autonomous agents in the model which can interact with each other, as well as with their surrounding environment (Bonabeau 2002).\n",
    "Such a characterisation involves the model containing information for each agent regarding their attributes and the rules by which they evolve.\n",
    "The rules pertaining to agent interaction aim to mirror the way in which we observe interactions occurring in reality; real interactions often occur with some level of variability and so the evaluation of the respective agent rules often involve some level of randomness.\n",
    "A model is therefore run by iterating forward through time, evaluating agent interaction rules at each time-step."

    "Furthermore, the stochastic nature of these models typically means that they must be run repeatedly with a given set of model parameters in order to deduce consistent system behaviour, further increasing computational cost.\n",
