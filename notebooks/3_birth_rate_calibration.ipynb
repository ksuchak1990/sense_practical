    "The aim of this notebook is to use the data provided to find a calibrated value for agent birth rate in the model.\n",
    "In this context, we take agent birth rate to mean the rate at which pedestrian agents are activated to enter the model environment, i.e. the station concourse.\n",
    "We can think of this as the number of pedestrians that may enter through the gates located at the edge of the model environment at each time-step/frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a lower birth rate, the number of pedestrians in the system is likely to remain consistently low, and as a consequence instances where pedestrians interact with each other will be infrequent.\n",
    "With a higher birth rate, the number of pedestrians in the system is likely to increase quickly, and we may therefore observe some crowding with agents being forced to interact with each other and find ways past each other.\n",
    "The level of crowding and interaction that we observe in a system will vary from scenario to scenario.\n",
    "In order for our model to accurately represent the behviour that we observe in the real-world system, we need to ensure that the parameter values that we use are accurate - this notebook therefore focuses on identifying a value for the `birth_rate` parameter, using the parameter values that we found in [the previous notebook](./2_speed_calibration.ipynb)."
